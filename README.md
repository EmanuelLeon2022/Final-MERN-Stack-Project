# FINALE
This project is a capstone of all my experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, REACT.js, Node.js, Express and MERN stack.

## E Leon
My name is [Emanuel Leon-Vargas](https://emanuelleon.onrender.com/), I am a rising software engineering student from [Per Scholas](https://perscholas.org/).
I have this website as my capstone assignment for Per Scholas, and as way of showcasing my skills to future employers, people interested in my work, my family and friends, and to myself. In the end my reason for making this assignment to fullest potential is because of this key moral, my work isn't just for those who asked for it, but also to [present to God my best work](https://biblehub.com/bsb/colossians/3.htm#:~:text=23Whatever%20you%20do%2C%20work%20at%20it%20with%20your%20whole%20being%2C%20for%20the%20Lord%20and%20not%20for%20men%2C%2024because%20you%20know%20that%20you%20will%20receive%20an%20inheritance%20from%20the%20Lord%20as%20your%20reward.%20It%20is%20the%20Lord%20Christ%20you%20are%20serving.)

### Home Page
Once you have fully logged in to the website you will have full access to the delights of this website, which include: [_*Steamboat Willie*_](https://www.theverge.com/24006670/mickey-mouse-steamboat-willie-enters-copyright-public-domain-2024) (which is now Public Domain) greeting you at the home page, my _*Snail Racers*_ game, 2 inventory pages, and an About page.

### Zelda API
One of these great delights is the open source Zelda API, you can use it to search up anything related to the famous game _*The Legend of Zelda: The Breath of the Wild*_, it will display where to find the item/creature, what it does, and a brief description about it. 

### Materials & Inventory
The way that this should work is by allowing you to

## The Show must go on
Once again this is my capstone project, so whatever happens from here on (in my github) after will be either for others, personal use/public use, or just storage.
It has been great doing these.
