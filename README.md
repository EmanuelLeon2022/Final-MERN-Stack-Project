# FINALE
This project is a capstone of all my experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, REACT.js, Node.js, Express and MERN stack.

## E Leon
My name is [Emanuel Leon-Vargas](https://emanuelleon.onrender.com/), I am a rising software engineering student from [Per Scholas](https://perscholas.org/).
I have this website as my capstone assignment for Per Scholas, and as way of showcasing my skills to future employers, people interested in my work, my family and friends, and to myself. In the end my reason for making this assignment to fullest potential is because of this key moral, my work isn't just for those who asked for it, but also to [present to God my best work](https://biblehub.com/bsb/colossians/3.htm#:~:text=23Whatever%20you%20do%2C%20work%20at%20it%20with%20your%20whole%20being%2C%20for%20the%20Lord%20and%20not%20for%20men%2C%2024because%20you%20know%20that%20you%20will%20receive%20an%20inheritance%20from%20the%20Lord%20as%20your%20reward.%20It%20is%20the%20Lord%20Christ%20you%20are%20serving.)

## Let the Games Begin
Throughout this page you will see a lot of my imagination placed throughout the page, most of them being fictional items, in the inventory and materials page set as placeholders. In my website you will find some of my past projects, some new ones, my resume page, and 

### Authentication Page
Upon opening the website you will be greeted by a lovely Authentication Page, which will stop you from entering the webpage unless you want to create an account, or if you already have an account you can log right in.

### Home Page
Once you have fully logged in to the website you will have full access to the delights of this website, which include: [_*Steamboat Willie*_](https://www.theverge.com/24006670/mickey-mouse-steamboat-willie-enters-copyright-public-domain-2024) (which is now Public Domain) greeting you at the home page, my _*Snail Racers*_ game, 2 inventory pages, my resume, and a Zelda API.

### Zelda API
One of these great delights is the open source Zelda API, you can use it to search up anything related to the famous game _*The Legend of Zelda: The Breath of the Wild*_, it will display where to find the item/creature, what it does, and a brief description about it. 

### Tools & Supplies
The way that this should work is it has the list of all the items you have in your inventory. The _*Tools*_ page contains the info about all of your gizmos and gadgets, their manufacturer, the usage of the item, and its requirements. The _*Supplies*_ page tells you what items you have in your pocket, such as food & materials.

### Me & Retro
On this page you will find my resume in two forms, a more formal one, and a cooler one...

*I think?*

### Issues
I had a lot of issues with the CSS on inventory pages, the loading of the mongoDB API's I made, and issues with the DELETE functions.

### How it Works
The backend of the website is running off of Express, which is pulling in the MongoDB and allowsthe users to login and out, if the backend is not running, there will be an infinite Authentication Page

## The Show must go on
Once again this is my capstone project, so whatever happens from here on (in my github) after will be either for others, personal use/public use, or just storage.
It has been great doing these.
