# FINALE
This project is a capstone of all my experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, REACT.js, Node.js, Express and MERN stack.

## E Leon
My name is [Emanuel Leon-Vargas](https://emanuelleon.onrender.com/), I am a rising software engineering student from [Per Scholas](https://perscholas.org/).
I have this website as my capstone assignment for Per Scholas, and as way of showcasing my skills to future employers, people interested in my work, my family and friends, and to myself. In the end my reason for making this assignment to fullest potential is because of this key moral, my work isn't just for those who asked for it, but also to [present to God my best work](https://biblehub.com/bsb/colossians/3.htm#:~:text=23Whatever%20you%20do%2C%20work%20at%20it%20with%20your%20whole%20being%2C%20for%20the%20Lord%20and%20not%20for%20men%2C%2024because%20you%20know%20that%20you%20will%20receive%20an%20inheritance%20from%20the%20Lord%20as%20your%20reward.%20It%20is%20the%20Lord%20Christ%20you%20are%20serving.)

## The Show must go on
Once again this is my capstone project, so whatever happens from here on after will be either for others, personal use/public use, or just storage.
It has been great doing these.
